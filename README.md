# 📚 Readimentary

**Readimentary** is a modern RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) speed‑reading app designed to help you read faster, stay focused, and build a consistent reading habit. It turns any text or book into a clean, distraction‑free reading experience while tracking meaningful reading metrics.

---

## 🚀 What is RSVP?

RSVP displays text **one word at a time at a fixed focal point**, eliminating eye movement and reducing cognitive load. This allows readers to significantly increase reading speed while maintaining comprehension.

Readimentary builds on this concept with habit‑tracking, analytics, and a thoughtful reading workflow.
